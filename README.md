# Implementation of a Vending Machine with Voice Recognition

Development of a basic Vending Machine using a Raspberry Pi 3 as a controller unit. 

## Used Devices

This Implementation uses:

- [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/)

## Repository Contents 

This Repository Contains the program used within the Raspberry Pi 3 model and the presentation of the final prototype.

## Description

This project served as an introduction of the Python Language for all team members. The objective is to implement a voice recognition interface between the user and the vending machine. The vending machine can accept the following commands:

- Ask for a Product
- Check available budget
- Change background music
- Check Balance

The machine construction as well as the internal circuit for activating the motors and accepting currency (done with marbles) as also developed by the team.

## Purpose

This projects serves as an simple experiment of the voice recognition protocol, the Raspberry Pi 3 controller and an introduction to the Python Language.
