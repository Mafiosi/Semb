# Vending Machine with Voice Recognition

Development of a basic Vending Machine using a Raspberry Pi 3 as a controller unit.

## Used Devices

This Implementation uses:

- [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/)

## Repository Contents

This Repository Contains the program used within the Raspberry Pi 3 model and the presentation of the final prototype.
Due to license restrains the audio files are not present in this repository.

## Description

This project served as an introduction to the Python Language for all team members.
The objective was to implement a voice recognition interface between the user and the vending machine.
The vending machine can accept the following commands:

- Ask for a Product
- Check available budget
- Change background music
- Check Balance

The machine construction as well as the internal circuit for activating the motors and accepting currency (done with marbles) was developed by the team.

## Purpose
